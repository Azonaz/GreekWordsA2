Words are divided into groups, and the counter on the right side of each group shows how many words you have already seen and the total number of words in that group.

In the Settings section, you can select your preferred language or enable blur mode to hide answers until you tap the screen.

You can see your quiz statistics and progress in the Statistics section.";

"trainingHelp" = "The Training section helps you reinforce Greek vocabulary using a spaced-repetition system inspired by Anki.

Once you open a topic in the Quiz section, all its words automatically become available for training. You can review flashcards at your own pace, while the app selects the optimal moment to repeat each word.

Each flashcard screen offers four rating options:
• Again — you couldn’t recall the word; the next review is scheduled sooner.
• Hard — the word is recalled with effort; the interval increases only slightly.
• Good — the word is remembered confidently.
• Easy — the word is well mastered; the interval increases noticeably more.

The algorithm analyzes your answers and determines the best time to show each word again, helping you store it in long-term memory.

The Statistics section includes two additional sets:
• Words you struggle with — according to the algorithm, these are learned the least reliably.
• Words you haven’t reviewed in a while — those that haven’t appeared in training for an extended period.

You can revisit these lists at any time to strengthen weak areas and maintain steady progress.
