Each round has 10 questions.

You can choose a game mode:
• By groups — words are grouped by topics, and the counter next to each group shows how many words you have already seen and the total number of words in that group;
• Random — words are selected from the entire vocabulary without being tied to specific topics.

In the Settings section, you can select your preferred language or enable blur mode to hide answers until you tap the screen.

You can see your quiz statistics and progress in the Statistics section.";

Once you open a topic in the Quiz section, all its words automatically become available for training. You can review flashcards at your own pace, while the app selects the optimal moment to repeat each word.

Each flashcard screen offers four rating options:
• Again — you couldn’t recall the word; the next review is scheduled sooner.
• Hard — the word is recalled with effort; the interval increases only slightly.
• Good — the word is remembered confidently.
• Easy — the word is well mastered; the interval increases noticeably more.

The algorithm analyzes your answers and determines the best time to show each word again, helping you store it in long-term memory.
